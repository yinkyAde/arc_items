## Curved Arc Menu (Flutter)

A swipeable, snapping **arc menu** with **concave U-shaped cards**, inspired by modern mobile assistants.  
- Smooth, single-cubic on the card itself  
- Centered icon + label  
- Gently fanned layout where cards “kiss” with a tiny gutter  
- Overflow-safe: tops don’t get clipped while swiping
